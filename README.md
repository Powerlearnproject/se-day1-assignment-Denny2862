#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It plays a major role in the technology industry as it helps create, run and manage softwares that solves problems. For example, the operating systems which help our computers deliver.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Software Crisis (Late 1960s-Early 1970s)
Problem: As software systems became more complex and critical, they often faced delays, cost overruns, and poor quality. This led to a crisis of confidence in the software industry.
Impact: This crisis spurred the development of structured programming, top-down design, and other methodologies to improve software development practices.
Key Figures: Edsger Dijkstra, Niklaus Wirth, and David Parnas played pivotal roles in addressing the software crisis.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s)
Concept: OOP introduced the idea of encapsulating data and behaviour into objects, promoting modularity and reusability.
Impact: OOP revolutionized software development, leading to the creation of popular languages like C++, Java, and Python.
Key Figures: Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and Grady Booch pioneered OOP.
3. Agile Software Development (Late 1990s-Early 2000s)
Methodology: Agile methodologies emphasise iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexible planning.
Impact: Agile practices helped address the limitations of traditional waterfall methodologies, leading to faster development cycles and improved product quality.
Key Figures: The Agile Manifesto, signed by a group of software developers, articulated agile development principles.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software product planning  and design- this involves laying the plan, the overall architecture, and all components of the software.
Development-Involves the actual coding and testing for bugs and integration of software components into a cohesive system.
Testing and deployment- Testing involves testing individuals and the system as a whole to check if the product meets the designed need. Deployment is the installation and configuration and making the system public.
Maintenance- This involves fixing any defects and upgrading to make sure the systems work appropriately and are up to date.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL
Sequential: Phases are completed one after another.
Rigid: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is complete.
Suitable for: Projects with well-defined requirements and stable environments.
Example: Building a bridge or constructing a building.
AGILE
Iterative: Development occurs in short cycles (sprints).
Flexible: Changes can be incorporated throughout the project.
Suitable for: Projects with uncertain requirements or rapidly changing environments.
Example: Developing a mobile app or a software product.
In summary, Waterfall is better suited for projects with predictable requirements and stable environments, while Agile is more flexible and adaptable for projects with uncertainty and frequent changes.

Version Control Systems (VCS)
Purpose: VCS track file changes over time, allowing developers to collaborate efficiently and manage different code versions.
Benefits:
Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.
History Tracking: Every change to the code is recorded, making it easy to revert to previous versions.
Branching and Merging: Developers can create separate branches for different features or bug fixes, and later merge them back into the main branch.
Backup and Recovery: VCS provides a reliable backup of your code, protecting against accidental deletions or data loss.
Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial
